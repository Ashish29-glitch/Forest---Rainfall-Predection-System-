# Forest-Rainfall-Predection-System-
This project implements a machine learning system to predict rainfall based on historical weather data using the XGBoost algorithm â€” a high-performance gradient boosting technique known for its speed and accuracy. This system aims to support better decision-making in agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness.
